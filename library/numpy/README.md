# Numpy
NumPy is a Python library for numerical computing. It provides
powerful data structures, such as n-dimensional arrays or “ndarrays”,
and a wide range of mathematical functions for working with these
arrays efficiently. 

In addition to its core functionality, NumPy also provides tools for
integrating with other scientific computing libraries in Python, such as
SciPy and Pandas. Overall, NumPy is an essential tool for anyone
working with numerical data in Python.
```
import numpy as np 
```
### Pros and Cons

## Pros:
* Efficient and fast: NumPy is built on top of low-level
languages like C and Fortran, which makes it much faster
and more efficient than pure Python code for numerical
computations.
* Powerful data structures: NumPy provides powerful ndimensional arrays, or “ndarrays”, which allow for efficient
storage and manipulation of large datasets.
* Comprehensive mathematical functions: NumPy provides
a wide range of mathematical functions, such as
trigonometric, logarithmic, and statistical functions, which
makes it easy to perform complex computations on arrays.
* Integration with other Python libraries: NumPy integrates
seamlessly with other scientific computing libraries in
Python, such as SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, which
allows for more advanced data analysis and visualization.

## Cons:
* Steep learning curve: NumPy can be challenging to learn,
especially for beginners who are not familiar with
programming concepts like arrays and vectorization.
* Memory usage: NumPy arrays can use a lot of memory,
which can be a problem when working with very large
datasets.
* Lack of flexibility: NumPy is optimized for numerical
computations and is not as flexible as pure Python code
for general-purpose programming tasks.
