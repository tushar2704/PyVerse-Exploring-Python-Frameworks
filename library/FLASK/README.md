## 1. Introduction to FLASK
FLASK is a micro web framework for Python that allows developers to build web applications quickly and easily. It is designed to be lightweight and modular, making it an ideal choice for small to medium-sized projects. FLASK is also highly extensible, allowing you to include a wide range of third-party libraries and plugins to enhance its functionality.

Some of the key features of FLASK include:
- Built-in development server and debugger
- Integrated support for unit testing
- RESTful request dispatching
- Jinja2 templating engine
- Secure cookies support (client-side sessions)
- 100% WSGI 1.0 compliant
- Unicode-based
- Extensive documentation and community support

FLASK's popularity is due in part to its simplicity and ease of use, making it an excellent choice for developers who are new to Python or web development. Additionally, FLASK's modular design allows for the creation of complex applications by integrating various extensions and plugins as needed.

## 2. Installing FLASK
Before we can start using FLASK, we need to install it on our machine. To do this, simply run the following command in your command prompt or terminal:

```
pip install Flask
```

This command will install FLASK and its dependencies, including Werkzeug and Jinja2, which are two essential components of the FLASK framework.

Once the installation is complete, you can verify it by running the following command:

```
python -c "import flask; print(flask.__version__)"
```

If the installation was successful, this command will output the current version of FLASK installed on your machine.

## 3. Building a Simple Web App with FLASK
Now that we have FLASK installed, let's create a simple web app to demonstrate its features. To get started, create a new Python file called `app.py` and enter the following code:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

This code defines a basic FLASK web app with a single route that displays the text "Hello, World!" when accessed. To run the app, simply execute the `app.py`
