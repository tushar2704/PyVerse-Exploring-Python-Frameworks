## 3. Loading and Displaying Images

Before diving into image processing tasks, it's essential to know how to load and display images using Scikit-image. The library provides several functions for reading and writing images in various formats.

### Loading Images

To load an image, you can use the `imread()` function from the `skimage.io` module. This function reads an image from a file and returns a NumPy array. For example, to load an image named `'sample_image.jpg'`, you can use the following code:

```python
from skimage import io

image = io.imread('sample_image.jpg')
```

### Displaying Images

To display an image, you can use the `imshow()` function from the `skimage.io` module. This function displays a NumPy array as an image. For example, to display the previously loaded image, you can use the following code:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.imshow(image)
plt.show()
```

 Image Segmentation

Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple regions based on certain criteria, such as color, texture, or intensity. Scikit-image for Python provides various algorithms for image segmentation, including thresholding, watershed, and region growing methods. In this section, we will explore some of these techniques.

### Thresholding

Thresholding is a simple and widely used segmentation technique that involves converting an image into a binary image by applying a threshold value to each pixel. Scikit-image provides several functions for thresholding, such as `threshold_otsu()`, `threshold_adaptive()`, and `threshold_mean()`.

For example, to perform Otsu's thresholding on a grayscale image, you can use the following code:

```python
from skimage import filters

grayscale_image = skimage.color.rgb2gray(image)
threshold_value = filters.threshold_otsu(grayscale_image)
binary_image = grayscale_image > threshold_value
```

### Watershed

The watershed algorithm is a more advanced segmentation technique that treats an image as a topographic surface and uses flooding simulations to separate regions. Scikit-image provides the `watershed()` function for this purpose.

For example, to apply the watershed algorithm to an image with markers, you can use the following code:

```python
from skimage import morphology, segmentation

markers = ...  # Define markers for the image
watershed_image = segmentation.watershed(image, markers)
```

## 5. Geometric Transformations

Geometric transformations involve modifying the geometric properties of an image, such as position, orientation, and scale. Scikit-image for Python provides various functions for performing geometric transformations, such as rotation, scaling, and affine transformations.

### Rotation

To rotate an image by a certain angle, you can use the `rotate()` function from the `skimage.transform` module.

For example, to rotate an image by 45 degrees, you can use the following code:

```python
from skimage import transform

rotated_image = transform.rotate(image, angle=45)
```

### Scaling

To scale an image, you can use the `rescale()` function from the `skimage.transform` module.

For example, to scale an image by a factor of 2, you can use the following code:

```python
scaled_image = transform.rescale(image, scale=2)
```

### Affine Transformations

Affine transformations are a combination of rotation, scaling, and translation operations. To perform an affine transformation on an image, you can use the `AffineTransform()` class and the `warp()` function from the `skimage.transform` module.

For example, to apply an affine transformation to an image, you can use the following code:

```python
import numpy as np

affine_transformation = transform.AffineTransform(rotation=np.pi/4, scale=(1.5, 1.5))
transformed_image = transform.warp(image, affine_transformation)
```

## 6. Color Space Manipulation

Color space manipulation involves converting images between different color spaces, such as RGB, HSV, and LAB. Scikit-image for Python provides various functions for color space conversion, such as `rgb2hsv()`, `rgb2lab()`, and `hsv2rgb()`.

For example, to convert an RGB image to the HSV color space, you can use the following code:

```python
hsv_image = skimage.color.rgb2hsv(image)
```

To convert the HSV image back to the RGB color space, you can use the following code:

```python
rgb_image = skimage.color.hsv2rgb(hsv_image)
```

## 7. Image Analysis

Image analysis involves extracting meaningful information from images, such as size, shape, and intensity of

 image regions. Scikit-image for Python provides various functions for image analysis, including region properties, intensity measurements, and object detection.

### Region Properties

To measure properties of labeled image regions, you can use the `regionprops()` function from the `skimage.measure` module.

For example, to calculate the area, perimeter, and centroid of labeled regions in a binary image, you can use the following code:

```python
from skimage import measure

labeled_image = measure.label(binary_image)
region_props = measure.regionprops(labeled_image)

for region in region_props:
    area = region.area
    perimeter = region.perimeter
    centroid = region.centroid
```

### Intensity Measurements

To measure the intensity of image regions, you can use the `intensity_image()` function from the `skimage.measure` module.

For example, to calculate the mean, min, and max intensity of labeled regions in an intensity image, you can use the following code:

```python
intensity_props = measure.regionprops(labeled_image, intensity_image=image)

for region in intensity_props:
    mean_intensity = region.mean_intensity
    min_intensity = region.min_intensity
    max_intensity = region.max_intensity
```

## 8. Filtering and Smoothing

Filtering and smoothing involve enhancing or suppressing features in images using various filters. Scikit-image for Python provides several filters for this purpose, such as Gaussian, median, and Sobel filters.

### Gaussian Filter

To apply a Gaussian filter to an image, you can use the `gaussian()` function from the `skimage.filters` module.

For example, to apply a Gaussian filter with a standard deviation of 1, you can use the following code:

```python
from skimage import filters

gaussian_filtered_image = filters.gaussian(image, sigma=1)
```

### Median Filter

To apply a median filter to an image, you can use the `median()` function from the `skimage.filters` module.

For example, to apply a median filter with a 3x3 window, you can use the following code:

```python
from skimage import filters

median_filtered_image = filters.median(image)
```

### Sobel Filter

To apply a Sobel filter to an image, you can use the `sobel()` function from the `skimage.filters` module.

For example, to apply a Sobel filter to a grayscale image, you can use the following code:

```python
sobel_filtered_image = filters.sobel(grayscale_image)
```

## 9. Morphological Operations

Morphological operations are a class of image processing techniques that involve modifying the shape and structure of objects in binary and grayscale images. Scikit-image for Python provides various functions for morphological operations, such as erosion, dilation, and skeletonization.

### Erosion

To perform erosion on a binary image, you can use the `erosion()` function from the `skimage.morphology` module.

For example, to apply erosion to a binary image, you can use the following code:

```python
from skimage import morphology

eroded_image = morphology.erosion(binary_image)
```

### Dilation

To perform dilation on a binary image, you can use the `dilation()` function from the `skimage.morphology` module.

For example, to apply dilation to a binary image, you can use the following code:

```python
dilated_image = morphology.dilation(binary_image)
```

### Skeletonization

To perform skeletonization on a binary image, you can use the `skeletonize()` function from the `skimage.morphology` module.

For example, to apply skeletonization to a binary image, you can use the following code:

```python
skeletonized

_image = morphology.skeletonize(binary_image)
```

## 10. Feature Detection and Extraction

Feature detection and extraction involve identifying and extracting specific features from images, such as corners, edges, and blobs. Scikit-image for Python provides various functions for feature detection and extraction, including corner detection, edge detection, and blob detection.

### Corner Detection

To detect corners in an image, you can use the `corner_harris()` or `corner_shi_tomasi()` function from the `skimage.feature` module.

For example, to detect corners in a grayscale image using the Harris corner detector, you can use the following code:

```python
from skimage import feature

corner_coords = feature.corner_harris(grayscale_image)
```

### Edge Detection

To detect edges in an image, you can use the `sobel()` or `canny()` function from the `skimage.feature` module.

For example, to detect edges in a grayscale image using the Sobel operator, you can use the following code:

```python
edge_image = feature.sobel(grayscale_image)
```

### Blob Detection

To detect blobs in an image, you can use the `blob_dog()`, `blob_log()`, or `blob_doh()` function from the `skimage.feature` module.

For example, to detect blobs in a grayscale image using the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) method, you can use the following code:

```python
blobs = feature.blob_log(grayscale_image, min_sigma=1, max_sigma=10, threshold=0.1)
```
